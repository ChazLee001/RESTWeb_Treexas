This file is to provide some guidance on using scripts.


Under the Application folder there is a shell script called "owl"

To use the script owl use ./owl    

However, this won't do anything. The purpose of owl is to run a script within this directory.

so owl takes in an argument to call a script within this directory.  

It takes the format of ./owl "script" where script is the name of a script in this directory


example: 

	./owl proxy "password"


	./owl migration 


	./owl deploy
