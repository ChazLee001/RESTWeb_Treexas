	<h4> Datasources </h4>
	<a href='//www.txsmartscape.com' >    Texas Plant Source </a>
	<p> This datasource was scraped using the HTMLParser and BeautifulSoup Python packages. Information about each plant, such as botanical name and growing conditions, were extracted from each plant</p>
	<a href='//www.tpwd.texas.gov'>    Texas State Park and Ecoregion Datasource </a>
	<p> This datasource was scraped using the HTMLParser and BeautifulSoup Python packages. Latitude and longitude information was scraped for the state parks. Descriptions and native plants were scraped for each of the texan ecoregions</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Tools</h4>
	<p> We used the Django web framework, along with Python to build our app. We used HTML, CSS and some very simple Javascript to build templates for our web pages. We used Google Cloud Platform to deploy our app, and acquired our domain name from namecheap.com. We also used MySQL as our database, and stored our information on Cloud SQL, from Google Cloud Platform. Data scraping was performed using the beautifulsoup Python package, while RESTful APIs were used when they were available. We used Node.js to build our API, then used Postman to test it. We also used Selenium for UI testing. </p>
