This is a file with some useful information, 
to test run the current app, navigate to plant_app/plants/
then run $python manage.py runserver
This will run the app on 'localhost:8000' which you can type into
any browser
The app probably won't run unless you have mySQL installed with the
following database/user info, because that's what Django is looking for

Database Name - plant_data
User - user1
Password - Blackalfredo1!

here are some links about using Django and setting up mySQL

Commands:

find processes running on ports
$netstat -ntlp

kill a process
kill -9 <PID>

Django:

create new project
django-admin startproject <project_name>

>create new app
python manage.py startapp <app_name>
then add appname to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
then run
python manage.py migrate

run test server
$python manage.py runserver <serverip>:8000
	-<serverip>:8000 is optional, if not specified, app with run on localhost:8000

Path function is passed four arguments 2 required - route and view
2 optional kwargs and name
route - string that contains a URL pattern
view - when django finds a matching pattern, it calls the specified
	view function with an HttpRequest object as the first 
	argument and any captures values from the route as keyword args
kwargs -other parguments as a dict
name - naming your url lets you refer to it unambiguously from anywhere in Django,
	lets you make global changes to the URL patterns while only touching a 
	single file

MySQL

install it and add security
$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install mysql-server
$sudo mysql_secure_installation

command line admin client
$mysqladmin

start sql from command line
mysql -u root -p

show current databases
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

create database
mysql> CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;

create user and grant them all privileges
mysql> CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

we will use mysqlclient, which is a Python 3 database connector libraary compatible with Django

start mysql.service again
sudo systemctl start mysql

restart mySQL
$systemctl daemon-reload
$systemctl restart mysql
